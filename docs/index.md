## Hierarchy of Intimacy

All the steps have to conform to the Principles above. For example: you share your public identity only if the other party does the same (according to Mirroring).

### Between 2 Persons

1. Sharing interfaces of negotiation: interface. This should be temporary and untraceable.
1. Sharing a temporary identity. This is called "stranger" relationship.
1. Sharing a non-temporary but secondary identity.
1. Sharing your legal identity.
1. Sharing your public ethos: ethos_1. This is called "acquaintance" relationship.
1. Allow for challenges to the validity of your ethos_1.
1. Allow for judgments concerning your ethos_1.
1. Allow for judgments concerning the other party's ethos_1. 
1. Make the previous step sustainable.
1. Sharing your product and services offer for friends: services_1. Here starts the most superficial "friendship" relationship.
1. Allow for the creation of a common ethos, ethos_3 between the 2 parties. The editing is collaborative.
1. Allow the other party to judge you according to ethos_3.
1. Make the previous step sustainable.
1. Allow for ethos_3 to become public. This is compatible with "marriage" and "committed friendship".
1. The group with ethos_3 becomes an institution and its proofs of authority are available to other institutions.

### Between A Person and An Institution

1. Sharing interfaces of negotiation: interface. This should be traceable by both sides.
1. Sharing your legal identity.
1. The person creates a profile with the institution: composing and sharing ethos_3
1. Allow the institution to judge you according to ethos_3.
1. Allow other institutions selective access to ethos_3 information: This is compatible with "citizenship" relationship.

### Between 2 Institutions

1. Sharing interfaces of negotiation: interface. This should be traceable by both sides.
1. Sharing proofs of authority.
1. Establishing role protocols, and composing the relationship contract.
1. Enacting the contract. The contract is the ethos_3 of the institutional group.
